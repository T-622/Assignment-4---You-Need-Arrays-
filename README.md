# Assignment-4---You-Need-Arrays-

Given Instructions:

Your program should 
make good use of appropriate structures and concepts: specifically:
â†’ list variables & associated methods
â†’ for loops
â†’ functions ðŸ†•
â†’ Timing methods
Again - I do not want you to use classes for this assignment
include well formatted and decriptive input and output messages to the user (with good use of blank lines / spacing, etc.)
error trap any and all user inputs appropriately
appropriate documentation - including:
â†’ program & function headers, 
â†’ descriptive variable & function names
â†’ comments interspersed throughout the code that explain the major logic blocks and functionality in your program
Basic (level 3) version of the program:
asks the user to enter
1. the number of random integer values they want generate
2. the lower limit for the random values, and
3. the upper limit for the random values...
creates a `list` (aka array) variable containing the specified number of random values (within the specified range)
allows the user to then enter an integer value (within the specified range) and search to see whether that number can be found in the list (*and* which position it was found)...
ask if they want to search for another value
ask if they want to create a new list of numbers
use functions as appropriate (e.g., for intro, conclusion and error trapping inputs)

More complex (some or all of the following): All of the above plus
find all instances of the search value in the rather than returning true if the value exists (assuming that values may be repeated in the array)
give the user the option to use a built-in function to determine if the value exists using
 - a linear search
 - binary search
NB - you must write these functions yourself
compare the lengths of time that these search methods take to find the specified value
write your own function to sort the contents of the array
other features as determined by you
There is no need for a play again loop in this program (because that is covered in the create a new list bullet)
